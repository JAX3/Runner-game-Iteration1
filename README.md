# Infinite Runner Iteration 1

## Week 1
For the first week  i mainly spent researching how to make a basic auto runner while using 
parts from [emoji-run](https://github.com/JAX3/emoji-run) to get a basic understanding on how to make an endless runner.


The main part of the week was also spent learning how to make the platform spawn before the player reaches them as I had some issue of the player moving to fast for the platforms to be generated though once this issue was fixed i had one major issue of the platform still existing within the world  and was causing some performance issues after 30seconds.
